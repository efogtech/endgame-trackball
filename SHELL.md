### Updating shell

Please take a look at the [new recommended method](https://github.com/efogtech/endgame-trackball/blob/main/ASSEMBLY.md#magnets) for installing magnets.  
In case you have a ferromagnetic surface to work on, you may use the included tool to put magnets into it — it will allow you to move the magnet tower sideways, breaking the attraction.  
Note that it's not recommended, just possible.
